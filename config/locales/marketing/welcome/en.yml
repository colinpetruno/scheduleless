            Trading shifts allows for an easy way for employees to work when it
            is most convenient for them. Trading shifts by your employees
            significantly lowers the number of cancellations. However, if they
            still need to cancel we will let all the eligible employees know
            and try to fill it as soon as possible.

          Other scheduling software claims to be free. But in order to be
