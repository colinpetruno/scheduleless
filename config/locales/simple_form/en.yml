      preference:
        break_length: >
          Amount of time given for a break. If the break is paid it is included
          in the shift. An 8 hour shift has 1 hour paid break. If it is not
          paid then an 8 hour shift will be scheduled for 9 hours. 
        maximum_shift_length: >
          Most amount of hours allowed per shift. This will ensure they do not
          go over this amount of time in a 24 hour period.
        minimum_hours_for_break: >
          How many hours must an employee work before they are eligable for a
          break?
        minimum_shift_length: >
          This is the smallest amount of time we will schedule an employee for.
          They need to work long enough to make traveling worthwhile! It's 
          recommended to keep this to over 3 hours.
        paid_break: >
          Do you pay your employees while they are on break?
        shift_overlap: >
          Allow a buffer to ensure that the next employee can get
          there and situated before the previous worker leaves.
      schedule_setting:
        lead_time: >
          This is how many periods we will additionally schedule ahead. If the 
          duration is 2 weeks and the periods are set to 2, you will have 1 
          active schedule and receive 2 additional ones ready to go for a 
          total of 6 weeks.
